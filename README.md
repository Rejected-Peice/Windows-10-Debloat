# Windows-10-Debloat
Mixing of some existing debloat scripts and adding some more spice to it!!

Took this (https://github.com/Sycnex/Windows10Debloater) as the base script and added some more stuff from this (https://github.com/W4RH4WK/Debloat-Windows-10) with some small additions from my side.

Used PS2EXE (https://github.com/MScholtes/PS2EXE) to compile into an exe file.

If you would like to see more stuff to be added to this program, post an issue, will look into it as soon as possible


# Usage

Just run the .exe file from the releases page, the GUI is pretty easy to use.

I made this as user friendly as possible 

You wont have to open the terminal or command line at all

Restart after you are done with debloating
